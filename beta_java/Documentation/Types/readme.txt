These types are extracted from the c++ library header file Types.h;
all enums are represented as classes. 
The vector implementations are done by built in SWIG functionallity 
to implement std c++ vectors.

For future releases these might be removed and type conversions to 
Java standard types (such as Abstract lists, hashMaps e.t.c.) 
might be used instead.
