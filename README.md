## C++
current version SDK c++:
1.4.6.4

SDK c++ version:
1.4.6

Release notes:
Fix for queryWithPath. API reachable both on CloudBackend class object and Container class objects.
Additional API from version 1.4.5 is the QueryChainPtr queryWithPath(std::string relativePath, ItemDelegatePtr delegate, uint64_t queryRoot) {}, QueryChain queryWithPath(std::string relativePath, ItemDelegatePtr delegate) {}. Returns the container with items on the specified cloud path relative to either rootContainer or a specified container (that will act as root for the path).

SDK c++ version:
1.4.5

Release notes:
Main update for this release is join functionality on queries. ex: query(filter, delegate)->join(ContainerToQuery, key1, key2, filter, ContainerForResults)
For more details check the header file for QueryChain class or online on cloudbackend.com.

Search has been added as a function of object search on whole account, ex search(string tag, containerId, delegate) will search the container structure (full container tree) for objects with the key and/or key:value. ex: search("artist|year:2006", rootContainerId, delegate) will return all objects that has the key artist and the key year with value 2006.

There is also search(CBE::Filter filter, ItemDelegatePtr delegate) on container, where you define your own filter for the search. bare in mind that a queryString would need to be set to filter out objects on the account, unless one only wants to see all objects in a ascending or decending order for instance.

Extended group functionality, added member functionality such as kick ban unban and listing of banned members on the group object.

SDK c++ version:
1.4.1

Release notes:
Extended group functionality, added create, join, listMembers, leave, remove, rename on the group object together with relevent data members like bool joined().

SDK c++ version:
1.4.0

Release notes:
Bug fixes, listGroups on groupManager added. CreateAccount added.
New CLI with new extended Readme.
