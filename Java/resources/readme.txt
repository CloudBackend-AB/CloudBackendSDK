The Config.properties contains credentials and preset paths to make the RunMe.java
code more flexible and easier to read.

In the Simple_test files are being uploaded which are contained in this folder (resources).

The com.cbe-source.jar is used for auto completion when writing code. It is however not fully tested. 
On the web site there is a class tree with all relevant classes created from javadoc and stubb code.
