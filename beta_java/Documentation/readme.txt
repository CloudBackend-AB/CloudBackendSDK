The Protocol and Types folder including this folder contains methods and 
API calls that can be used with the java wrapped cloudbackend sdk version.
Do not compile these files; they are simply to help out on how to use / for readability.

To see an simple example on how to use some of the methods see the Simple_test folder, 
those are compilable for a simple test.

Wrappers have been auto generated by SWIG 
(Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) version 4.0.2. 
The CloudBackend SDK do depend on parts of the Poco library
and as part oif that solution openssl is part of that as well. 
These libraries are included in the lib folder.
